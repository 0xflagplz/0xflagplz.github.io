</head><body>Artifact Kit<br/>
------------<br/>
This package contains source code for Cobalt Strike's Artifact Kit. This kit is designed to ease the <br/>
development of anti-virus safe artifacts.<br/>
<br/>
Cobalt Strike uses artifacts from this kit to generate executables and DLLs that are safe from some<br/>
anti-virus products. Load the included artifacts.cna script to force Cobalt Strike to use your artifacts<br/>
over the built-in ones.<br/>
<br/>
Cobalt Strike uses these artifacts in the following places:<br/>
<br/>
	* Attacks -&gt; Packages -&gt; Windows Executable<br/>
	* Attacks -&gt; Packages -&gt; Windows Executable (S)<br/>
	* Attacks -&gt; Web Drive-by -&gt; Scripted Web Delivery (bitsadmin and exe)<br/>
	* Beacon's 'elevate svc-exe' command<br/>
	* Beacon's 'jump psexec' and 'jump psexec64' commands<br/>
<br/>
How it Works<br/>
------------<br/>
Most anti-virus products use signatures to detect known malware. To defeat packers and crypters these<br/>
products use a virtual machine sandbox to step-through a binary and check each step against the database<br/>
of known signatures. The A/V sandboxes do not emulate all possible things a program can do. Artifact Kit <br/>
binaries force shellcode through a process that many A/V engines can not emulate. This causes the A/V<br/>
engine to give up on processing the artifact.<br/>
<br/>
dist-readfile/ (implemented in src-common/bypass-readfile.c):<br/>
	This bypass opens the current artifact file, skips to where the shellcode is stored,<br/>
	reads it, and decodes it. This is the default artifact kit loaded with Cobalt Strike.<br/>
<br/>
dist-pipe/ (implemented in src-common/bypass-pipe.c)<br/>
	This bypass creates a named pipe to serve the obfuscated shellcode and a client to<br/>
	read it. Once the client reads the obfuscated shellcode it decodes it. <br/>
<br/>
Recompile<br/>
---------<br/>
To recompile everything:<br/>
<br/>
$ ./build.sh<br/>
<br/>
You will need the following:<br/>
<br/>
- Minimal GNU for Windows Cross-Compiler - apt-get install mingw-w64<br/>
<br/>
HOWTO - Add a New Bypass<br/>
-----<br/>
1. Create a file in src-common/, name it bypass-[your technique here].c<br/>
2. Open build.sh and add a line for your technique at the bottom<br/>
<br/>
Integration<br/>
-----------<br/>
To use your new Artifact Kit, load artifact.cna into Cobalt Strike. Each variant of the<br/>
Artifact Kit lives in its own folder. The artifact.cna script contains a Cortana filter to<br/>
tell Cobalt Strike to use your Artifact Kit over the built-in option.<br/>
<br/>
Go to Cobalt Strike -&gt; Scripts, press Load.<br/>
