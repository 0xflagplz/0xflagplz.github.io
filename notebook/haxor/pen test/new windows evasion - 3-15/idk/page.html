What ive learned from reading all of this AV evasion is the proliminary tools which pen testers operate out of are cobalt strike and probably some metasploit. Metasploit is used by blackhats as well but most likely a cracked version of cobalt strike. Cobalt strike runs for about 25,000 per user per year apparently, I can buy the cracked for 1k. <br/>
Once the actor gains a shell they generally attempt to navigate towards the DC or an admin account. Using BOF (beacon object file) they can quietly work their way around. Once they have access they can use a ransomware, lockbit 2.0 seems to be one of the fastest and easily accessable. Someone who may not be knowledgable can scower these files for confidential daata as well as make password username lists. These lists can then be put into cracking applications which just need a proper configuration for the website you are going to check the accounts on. Once I had kind of explored the whole ransomeware blackhat scene it peaked my forever curious quesiton of evading AV.<br/>

Most exes will be caught. What appears to be the most effective are excel documents as well as dll injection. The HTA file has yet to be explored. Along with this AV evasion comes applications such as <a href="https://github.com/jthuraisamy/SysWhispers2">syswhisper2</a>which can be utilized to make direct syscalls while avoiding detection. Syswhisper does this by essentially renaming the blacklisted syscalls and creating header / source files and setting the ASM files to allow Macro Assembly.</body></html>
